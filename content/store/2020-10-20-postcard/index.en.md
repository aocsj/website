On May 27th, The World Otter Day, our original illustration made by Mr. Urushi Kagijo, a famous illustrator of otters in Japan, got viral!
Therefore, we decided to release the “AOCSJ original postcard set (5 cards)”! The price is **$9 (Shipping fee included)**, available in domestic and abroad!

## Contents of the AOCSJ original postcard set
Our society mainly acts for otter conservation in the Asian region. Therefore, this time, we have selected four otter species living in Asia, the Eurasian otter, Asian small-clawed otter, Smooth-coated otter, and Hairy-nosed otter!

1. AOCSJ World Otter Day Illustration  
Original illustration by a very famous illustrator of otters in Japan, Mr. Urushi Kagijo! Collaboration with our society!

2. Eurasian otter (*Lutra lutra*)  
Although this species is distributing broadly in Eurasia, it is designated as a Near Threatened (NT) species on the IUCN Red List, and its population is in decline. In this picture, you can see a female Eurasian otter kept in the Korean Otter Research Center. 
 
3. Asian small-clawed otter (*Aonyx cinereus*)
This species inhabits broadly in South-East Asia; however, its population is declining due to the destruction of wetlands, poaching, or online trading for pets. The Asian small-clawed otter is designated as a Vulnerable (VU) species on the IUCN Red List. This picture was taken in the National zoo in Malaysia. 
 
4. Smooth-coated otter (*Lutrogale perspicillata*)
Smooth-coated otters are found from India to South-East Asian countries and in Iraq. Their population decreases steadily. The otter in this photograph is resting on the mangrove bank after catching fish in the stream. Location: the Mergui Archipelago, Andaman Sea (Myanmar). IUCN Red List Category: VU (vulnerable).

5. Hairy-nosed otter (*Lutra sumatrana*)
While Hairy-nosed otter is sometimes seen by camera traps or traffic accidents in South-East Asian countries, its ecology or distribution situation is unclear. This species needs urgent protection and is designated as an Endangered (EN) species on the IUCN Red List. You can see a Hairy-nosed otter kept in Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Center in Cambodia. 
 
Profits are going to be used for otter conservation activities.
Thank you for your support!
